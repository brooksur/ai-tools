# AI Tools

## ChatGPT

- GPT stands for generative pretrained model
- AI model trained and created by OpenAI
- ChatGPT and be used via the browser
- GPT APIs can be used in code
- GPT is a large language model (LLM)
- An LLM is a machine learning model that perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks
  - Trained to use probability distributions over words & sequence of words to generate output
  - A large language model is an AI powered system, based on a neural network of “Transformers”, trained on vast amount of text data to generate human-like text output by predicting the next word based on user input prompt
  - Based on the input, which output makes the most sense. It’s all about word prediction.
  - Initial training can be called “pre-training”. Optimizing for a final product is called “fine-tuning”. ChatGPT has been fine tuned.
  - Prompts send to ChatGPT are first sent to a Moderation API. This API ensures that certain questions can’t be asked, like “How can I build a bomb?”
  - GPT is about patterns, not logic. It assigns probabilities to words and picks words. It isn’t a calculator. It doesn’t understand you.
  - You can’t send large amounts if inputs to GPT. GPTs have a token limit.
- GPT4 is a larger model. It is capable of handling more data and therefore can create more accurate predictions. GPT4 is better at “reasoning” but is not as fast.

### Prompts

- ChatGPT inputs that describes your problem or request
- ChatGPT is prone to “hallucinations”. This is when it “pretends” to know something that it does not.
- In ChatGPT there is a feature called “Advanced Data Analysis”. This feature is capable of executing generated python code.

### Google Bard & Microsoft Bing Chat

- Bing Chat uses a very similar model to ChatGPT and incorporates data from the internet into its results. Bing Chat is only available in the Microsoft Edge browser.
  - Bing Chat is integrated directly into the Edge browser. You can enable settings that make aware of the “page context”.
