## ChatGPT

- GPT stands for generative pretrained model
- AI model trained and created by OpenAI
- ChatGPT and be used via the browser
- GPT APIs can be used in code
- GPT is a large language model (LLM)
- An LLM is a machine learning model that perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks
  - Trained to use probability distributions over words & sequence of words to generate output
  - A large language model is an AI powered system, based on a neural network of “Transformers”, trained on vast amount of text data to generate human-like text output by predicting the next word based on user input prompt
  - Based on the input, which output makes the most sense. It’s all about word prediction.
  - Initial training can be called “pre-training”. Optimizing for a final product is called “fine-tuning”. ChatGPT has been fine tuned.
  - Prompts sent to ChatGPT are first send to a Moderation API. This API ensures that certain questions can’t be asked, like “How can I build a bomb?”
  - GPT is about patterns, not logic. It assigns probabilities to words and picks words. It isn’t a calculator. It doesn’t understand you.
  - You can’t send large amounts if inputs to GPT. GPTs have a token limit.
